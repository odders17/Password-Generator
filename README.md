Using java script to be able to generate a password on command

I wanted to showcase the different skills I have learned using html, css and java script to be able to demonstrate my ability to use java on a webpage.
I've recently covered many different areas in java and and started to grasp the different concepts of how it can be used to add dynamism to a website.
I've still got a very limited understanding of all the variables and functions of java and did find this very challanging but i enjoyed it none the less 
and will continue to try and understand the range in which java can be implemented to html.
